# Examply

Static Site Generator that generates content depending on the url!

`https://examply.now.sh/<placeholder>/<path>` will generate an dynamic, SSR-ed page with full OGP and Meta tags and so on.

Try me: [https://examply.now.sh/Examply/Awesome/webapp/it/is](https://examply.now.sh/Examply/Awesome/webapp/it/is)
